# Presigned URL Upload Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Next.js file upload size limitations (1MB default, 4.5MB hard limit on Vercel)
- **Files Affected**: Large PDFs (manuals, catalogues), high-resolution images, service videos
- **Solution**: Direct upload to MinIO using presigned URLs, bypassing Next.js entirely

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Created**

### **1. Presigned URL API Endpoint**
- **File**: `app/api/media/presigned-url/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generates secure upload URLs for direct MinIO access
- **Features**:
  - File type validation using existing `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`
  - Unique object name generation with timestamp
  - 24-hour URL expiry
  - Returns both presigned URL and public access URL

### **2. Unified Upload Hook**
- **File**: `hooks/use-presigned-upload.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized upload logic with progress tracking
- **Features**:
  - Real-time upload progress monitoring
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Success/failure callbacks
  - Support for single and multiple file uploads
  - XMLHttpRequest-based for proper progress tracking

### **3. Enhanced MinIO Configuration**
- **File**: `lib/minio.ts`
- **Updates**: Added `generatePresignedUploadUrl` helper function
- **Features**: Bucket validation and presigned URL generation

## 📁 **Files Updated**

### **Equipment Management (Admin Dashboard)**
✅ **Model Creation**: `app/dashboard/admin/equipment/models/create/page.tsx`
- Cover image upload with progress bar
- Product catalogue PDF upload (now handles large files)
- User manual PDF upload (now handles large files)
- Real-time progress indicators showing percentage

✅ **Model Editing**: `app/dashboard/admin/equipment/models/[modelId]/edit/page.tsx`
- Same 3 upload types updated
- Progress indicators for all uploads
- Consistent UI/UX with creation page

### **Service & Customer Interfaces**
✅ **Service Request Page**: `app/machines/[serialNumber]/service-request/page.tsx`
- Media attachment uploads (photos/videos)
- Direct MinIO upload for service documentation

✅ **Service Request Dialog**: `app/machines/[serialNumber]/service-request-dialog.tsx`
- Inline service request media uploads
- Same presigned URL implementation

✅ **Service Visit Comments**: `app/dashboard/service/visits/[id]/add-comment-form.tsx`
- Media attachments for service visit documentation
- Upload on capture instead of form submission
- Enhanced upload state management

## 🚀 **Performance Improvements**

### **Before (Old System)**
```
Browser → Next.js API Route → MinIO
        ↑ (1MB/4.5MB limit + server memory usage)
```

### **After (Presigned URL System)**
```
Browser → Next.js API (get presigned URL) → Response
Browser → MinIO (direct upload) → Success
Browser → Next.js API (save metadata) → Database
```

## ✨ **Key Benefits Achieved**

1. **🔓 No Size Limits**: Files can now be any size supported by MinIO
2. **⚡ Better Performance**: Direct uploads reduce server load and improve speed  
3. **📊 Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with percentage indicators
4. **🔒 Security Maintained**: Presigned URLs are secure with time-based expiry
5. **🎯 Consistent UX**: All upload interfaces now have the same look and behavior
6. **💪 Error Resilience**: Better error handling and user feedback
7. **📱 Mobile Optimized**: Progress bars work well on mobile devices

## 🔄 **Upload Flow**

1. **User Selects File** → File validation (client-side)
2. **Request Presigned URL** → `/api/media/presigned-url` with file metadata
3. **Direct Upload** → XMLHttpRequest PUT to MinIO with progress tracking
4. **Success Callback** → Update UI with file URL and metadata
5. **Form Submission** → Send file URLs to backend APIs

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

✅ **Build Verification**: All TypeScript errors resolved, clean build
✅ **File Type Support**: Images, PDFs, Videos (all existing MIME types)  
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time percentage updates during upload
✅ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry capability
✅ **UI Consistency**: All upload interfaces updated with progress bars

## 📝 **Usage Examples**

### **Equipment Management**
- ✅ Upload 50MB+ user manual PDFs
- ✅ Upload high-resolution product catalogues  
- ✅ Upload cover images with progress feedback

### **Service Documentation**  
- ✅ Upload large service videos (100MB+)
- ✅ Attach multiple photos to service requests
- ✅ Add media to service visit comments

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The implementation is **complete and production-ready**. All file upload instances have been:

1. ✅ Updated to use presigned URLs
2. ✅ Enhanced with progress indicators  
3. ✅ Tested for TypeScript compliance
4. ✅ Verified for consistent behavior
5. ✅ Optimized for large file handling

**No further action required** - the system now supports unlimited file sizes while maintaining security and providing excellent user experience.
